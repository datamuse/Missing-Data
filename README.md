# Missing-Data

This repository is a collection of information about missing data. Many types of analysis do not work with missing data. Often the default is to delete any records with missing data (listwise deletion) and continue the analysis. However if the missing data is not randomly distributed, then by deleting the missing data you can introduce bias. And even if the data is randomly distributed, after listwise deletion you could end up with a very small sample. Luckily, there are many ways to solve this problem including using methods that work with missing data. Some are better than others but they are what we've got.

I am not an expert in missing data. I am learning all of this too. The topic interests me and I hope that my search for answers can help you in yours.
